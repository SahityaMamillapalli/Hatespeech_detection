# Hatespeech_detection
With the increasing use of social networks, we see that many teenagers, youngsters, and adults face problems on online web platforms. This is a serious problem, and we must attach the utmost importance to solving these problems. Governments issue many rules and regulations to stop this type of hate crime and harassment online. In this project, we will use text analytics to extract the words from a tweet and we will use various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to determine if the tweet belongs to a hate crime category or an offensive category, or a neutral category. The source of the data is a tweet dump available as a dataset on the Kaggle website and we perform some data pre-processing and cleaning techniques prior to modeling to get accurate results. I have used different machine learning algorithms and selected the best one that offers the highest accuracy. Finally, I was  able to categorize the tweets into three different categories and we can use this as a mechanism to see if the posted tweet or comment belongs to a hate crime category. In the future, I can implement some techniques to block or stop these hate crimes/offensive tweets on social media websites.
